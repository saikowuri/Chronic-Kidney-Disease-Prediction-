# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured 
if treated it in the early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests,
we take for different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases.
Consequently, attributes of various medical tests are investigated to distinguish which attributes may contain helpful information about the disease.
The information says that it helps us to measure the severity of the problem, the predicted survival of the patient after the illness, the pattern of the disease and work for curing the disease.

In this report, we try to Use various machine learning Algorithms to build a prediction model for CKD detection. We validate  each model by  testing  its accuracy and select the best model.
